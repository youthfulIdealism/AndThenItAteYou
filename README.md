# AndThenItAteYou
Source code for And Then It Ate You (  https://andthenitateyougame.tumblr.com/  ). With the exception of a handful of MIT-liscenced files, I retain ownership of everything in this repo.

THIS WILL NOT RUN. And Then It Ate You is my project. I want the code acessible so that anyone can learn from it, but I'm not giving away copies of the game for free. As a result, none of the assets are included in this repo. You won't be able to make it run without the assets.

And Then It Ate You is built on top of Monogame, which is a C# framework. If you notice things I can improve, don't hesitate to let me know. I'm always looking to learn.
